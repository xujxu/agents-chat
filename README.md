# Agents Chat

A standalone multi-agent chat UI for **ACP (Agent Client Protocol)** agents. Direct communication with ACP-compatible CLI tools — GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and any ACP-compliant agent.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **npm** >= 10
- At least one ACP-compatible agent installed (GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, etc.)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # starts on https://localhost:3010
```

Open [https://localhost:3010](https://localhost:3010).

> **Note:** `npm run dev` enables HTTPS via `--experimental-https`. Accept the self-signed cert on first load.

## Mobile browser compatibility

New and restored empty chats show a welcome view with `/` command and `@`
agent hints until the first conversation message. This view is not saved as
chat history. The composer placeholder shares the message-body typography;
mobile input text remains at least 16px to avoid focus-triggered zoom.

Markdown uses a document-wide text-adjustment policy to keep its font
sizes stable across portrait and landscape. Native pinch zoom remains
available.

Chat reading position is anchored to the bottom of the visible conversation
across orientation changes. Following the latest messages stays at the bottom;
when reading history, the same visible text or image position remains near the
composer. Scrolling manually establishes a new reading position.

**Known limitation:** In the observed iPhone Chrome environment, pinching
larger, returning to original scale, releasing, then rotating can leave
the whole page unexpectedly zoomed. This also reproduced on an isolated
HTML page without the chat runtime; the paired Safari trial stayed at
original scale. The typography fix does not correct this native page-zoom
behavior. Safari is a verified temporary alternative for that observed
case, not a guarantee across every browser or OS version.

## Production

For persistent deployment, use one of the platform-specific scripts below. Both handle build + restart + health check in one command.

### Optional self-hosted voice input (experimental)

Voice input is **disabled by default**; installation and upgrades preserve that
state unless an administrator explicitly enables it. The selected local model
transcribes into the existing draft without sending a message or invoking an
agent. No paid speech API is required.

**Current status:** optional installation, upgrade/keep/disable, and real
browser-to-model-to-draft flows passed GitHub Actions using Linux systemd and
Windows Server 2022 Scheduled Tasks ([service evidence](https://github.com/xujxu/agents-chat/actions/runs/36141303634)).
This is functional coverage, not real Windows 11, physical-microphone or
real-phone qualification. Accuracy research is paused; previous failed quality
gates remain failed. Windows voice package public distribution is deferred and
its static-runtime redistribution permission remains unconfirmed. No native
voice package is approved as a permanent public release.

Start with the [installation and upgrade instructions](#voice-setup-on-installation-and-upgrade)
below. SenseVoiceSmall q8 is the current experimental acquisition option;
Whisper remains an explicitly configured compatibility option, not an automatic
fallback. Model/native binaries are acquired separately, not shipped inside the
application's standalone bundle.

For historical/manual Whisper configuration, the **Voice input PoC** Actions workflow
builds and verifies an AVX2/FMA/F16C/BMI2 x86_64 Linux CPU-only `whisper-cli` compatible with glibc
2.31+, together with the multilingual `ggml-base-q5_1.bin` model and licenses.
Configure `VOICE_ENABLED=1`, `VOICE_WHISPER_PATH`, and `VOICE_MODEL_PATH` using
absolute paths to those verified artifacts, then restart the app. The host needs
`/usr/bin/nice`, `/usr/bin/prlimit`, and (for the legacy policy) `/proc/meminfo`.
Do not expose a separate model server port. Set `VOICE_ENABLED=0` and restart to
disable the capability.

The unified native adapter also supports the pinned **official SenseVoiceSmall
GGUF q8** build with the pinned thread/error patch. For explicit configuration,
set `VOICE_MODEL=sensevoice-small-q8`, `VOICE_BINARY_PATH` and `VOICE_MODEL_PATH`
to absolute paths to that executable and model. `VOICE_THREADS` accepts `1`, `2`
or `4` (Sense defaults to `2`). Do not point this adapter at an unpatched upstream
binary or an ONNX model. Adapter/API/browser fixture regressions and a real Sense
authenticated-API smoke passed Actions35965252088. A transactional installer for
verified Actions packages is available below. Installed Linux Sense passed the
frozen100 authenticated direct-WAV API gates in Actions `35991326454`.
Controlled Chromium browser measurements subsequently passed on Linux and
Windows Server; Edge passed its browser path, while mobile-emulated WebKit
failed a mixed-language quality gate. Overall quality acceptance and public
runtime release publication remain pending. These are installation candidates,
not release-approved models.
See `scripts/VOICE-DEPLOYMENT.txt` for exact versions and qualification evidence.
The formal cross-platform design is
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-install-selected-voice-input-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-install-selected-voice-input-design.md).
Native Windows 11 Intel/AMD x64 support is required by that design. A Windows
development runtime path now requires explicit `VOICE_MODEL`, `standard` policy,
absolute local `.exe` paths for `VOICE_BINARY_PATH` and `VOICE_LAUNCHER_PATH`,
and `VOICE_MODEL_PATH`. The launcher must be the matching `voice-job.exe` with
private-directory and bounded-file operations, not the earlier lifecycle-only
build. Both real Windows model candidates now have version 2 import manifests
and pass verified staging plus installed-engine transcription from Unicode
paths (Actions `35981880883`). Import checks CPU/OS compatibility and reports
available resources without adding CPU/RAM quotas. The separate `candidate.json`
inventory is not an import manifest. Private Windows configuration files and
byte-preserving rollback now pass Actions `35984193290`, including old UTF-16LE
configuration. The configurator and Windows setup/upgrade entry points now
support these explicitly supplied candidate packages; they do not download a
public runtime automatically.
Actual Windows 11 qualification remains pending (CI uses Windows Server 2022).
Installed Windows Server Sense delivered 100/100 frozen samples and passed latency
gates, but failed the mixed-language medium-duration accuracy gate (16.89% error
versus a 16.67% ceiling). Whisper failed quality and latency gates on both
platforms. Windows full acceptance and public redistribution approval remain
pending; successful installation does not imply qualified recognition quality.

Explicit `VOICE_MODEL=whisper-base-q5_1` selects the compatibility model (default
one thread) using `VOICE_BINARY_PATH`, or `VOICE_WHISPER_PATH` if the generic path
is unset. Explicit models default to `VOICE_RESOURCE_POLICY=standard`: normal
per-request subprocesses, **no application CPU/RAM hard quota**, and no additional
systemd or Docker requirement. Thread count is not a CPU quota. External
OS/container limits still apply. Administrators on shared hosts should provision
adequate memory or configure deployment-level limits; standard mode does not
promise protection against host-wide memory pressure. The experimental 2CPU/4GiB
allocation is not a minimum installation requirement.

Existing configurations with no `VOICE_MODEL` retain `legacy-low-memory`.
Switching an existing deployment to standard mode must be an explicit
administrator change; no production settings are modified automatically.
The legacy policy can also be explicitly selected for one-thread Whisper only.
Unknown model IDs, unsupported policies/threads, and missing native files fail
with `voice_not_configured`, never an automatic model fallback. `/api/voice`
reports the selected model, provider, threads and resource policy; disabled
capabilities have a null model.

The microphone appears beside the attachment button when configured. HTTPS (or
localhost), microphone permission, AudioWorklet, and OfflineAudioContext are
required. Click once to record, again to transcribe, or cancel to discard.
Recording automatically stops after 30 seconds. Results append to the current
draft without overwriting edits or automatically sending. Changing chats/accounts,
opening the file editor, leaving the page, or backgrounding the tab cancels work.
Actual iPhone microphone behavior and Chinese recognition quality still require
real-device evaluation; Playwright WebKit is not a physical-iPhone benchmark.

The browser uploads at most 960,044 bytes of 16 kHz mono 16-bit WAV, below nginx's
default 1 MiB limit, without FFmpeg or third-party transcription calls. Only
authenticated, same-origin clients with the matching account may submit/cancel.
One inference runs at a time per app process; excess requests are rejected
instead of queued. The PoC assumes a single Next.js process. All providers use
a 120-second deadline; Linux additionally uses niceness 10.
Only `legacy-low-memory` (Linux only) uses one
thread, a 1 GiB **address-space** ceiling, and
requires at least 768 MiB `MemAvailable` before starting. While running, a
100 ms watchdog terminates inference if sampled peak RSS exceeds 384 MiB or host
available memory falls below 256 MiB. The address-space limit includes virtual
reservations and is not an RSS limit; the watchdog is sampled, not an atomic OS
memory quota. These protections reduce contention but cannot guarantee against
host-wide memory/CPU pressure. The proxy must allow at least the 120-second
inference deadline (`proxy_read_timeout 150s` for nginx); its upload-size limit
does not need changing.
Each request loads the model anew; there is no permanently resident model.
Transcripts are bounded to 32 KiB of valid UTF-8. Cancellation and timeout
terminate the native process group on Linux or the owned Windows Job, including
descendants. Windows Job configuration controls lifecycle, not CPU/RAM quotas.

Temporary audio/results are deleted after success, failure, or cancellation and
are not saved in chat history. Linux native core dumps are disabled. Windows
request directories are created with a protected ACL for the service identity,
SYSTEM and administrators; the temporary volume must support persistent ACLs
(for example NTFS, not FAT/exFAT). Whisper results are opened without following reparse
points and reject directories, hard links and oversized files. Logs contain durations, sizes, exit status, and
error codes, never audio/transcript contents. A host crash or forced application
kill can bypass cleanup: `agents-chat-voice-*` directories in the OS temporary
directory may require removal after confirming no transcription is running.
Do not enable this PoC on multiple workers without a shared admission controller.

#### Voice setup on installation and upgrade

Every **interactive Linux or Windows deployment/upgrade** offers voice configuration, with
**keep current settings** selected by pressing Enter. This preserves old Whisper
paths and their resource policy. Fresh installs stay disabled unless explicitly
configured. Noninteractive upgrades do not wait for input, do not download models,
and preserve existing settings. Explicitly disabling voice hides the microphone
button after service restart and page reload; it is not a greyed-out control.

The configurator can also be run separately, including from a standalone release
bundle. It needs Node.js, but no npm install or development dependencies:

```bash
node scripts/configure-voice.mjs                      # interactive menu
node scripts/configure-voice.mjs --non-interactive    # preserve, no prompt
node scripts/configure-voice.mjs --model disabled     # persist opt-out
sudo bash scripts/deploy.sh --voice disabled         # configure + build/restart
sudo bash scripts/deploy.sh --voice keep --non-interactive
```

**First upgrade from a version predating voice setup:** the old deployment script
cannot be made to execute new code it has already read. Pull the new version
first, then invoke its installer, so voice setup is offered on that upgrade:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
sudo bash scripts/deploy.sh --no-pull
```

Once updated, `sudo bash scripts/upgrade.sh` provides the pull-then-new-installer
entry point. The new `deploy.sh` also re-executes itself after pulling updates.
Starting the application is never an installation prompt.

For Windows source installations, `scripts/setup.ps1` and `scripts/deploy.ps1`
offer keep/Sense/Whisper/disabled on every interactive invocation. Their
`-NonInteractive` option preserves voice settings unless `-VoiceModel` is given
(it does not automate unrelated tunnel/account setup prompts). Run deploy from
an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
# First migration from an old release: pull before invoking the new script.
git pull --ff-only
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -SkipGitPull

.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -VoiceModel disabled -NonInteractive
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -VoiceModel sensevoice-small-q8 `
  -VoicePackageDir 'C:\voice packages\sense' `
  -VoiceManifestSha256 '<trusted-64-character-sha256>'
```

The new Windows deploy script re-enters the pulled version before configuration,
preserves an existing Scheduled Task's account, and defaults new tasks to the
installing account. `-NoWait` cannot be combined with a changed voice setting:
activation must wait for app readiness. Failed activation attempts guarded
configuration rollback and a normal task restart; incomplete recovery retains
the private receipt and reports an error.

Windows packages come from a successful **Voice Windows native candidates**
Actions run and have a version 2 `voice-package.json` plus the matching helper.
Use native Intel/AMD x64 Windows with the required CPU instructions and an NTFS
configuration volume. For standalone/manual configuration targeting another
service account, pass `--service-user ACCOUNT-OR-SID` (`setup.ps1`:
`-VoiceServiceUser`). Its user registry hive must be loaded, normally by signing
in as that account, so overrides can be inspected. The configurator does not
load hives, change accounts or grant Everyone access. It gives the target account
read access to the environment, but not to recovery receipts.

**Candidate packages, not public releases:** the **Voice native installation
packages** Actions workflow builds Sense GGUF q8 and Whisper base-q5_1 separately,
targeting glibc 2.35+ with AVX2/FMA/F16C/BMI2. Download and extract the appropriate
`voice-install-*` artifact from a trusted successful run. Obtain the SHA-256 of
`voice-package.json` through that trusted artifact/evidence; a checksum supplied
by an untrusted download alone does not establish authenticity.

```bash
node scripts/configure-voice.mjs --model sensevoice-small-q8 \
  --package-dir /absolute/path/to/extracted-package \
  --manifest-sha256 <trusted-64-character-sha256>
# Or combine verified package import with deployment:
sudo bash scripts/deploy.sh --voice sensevoice-small-q8 \
  --voice-package /absolute/path/to/extracted-package \
  --voice-manifest-sha256 <trusted-64-character-sha256>
```

**Explicit experimental acquisition:** authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh`) with
access to this repository's Actions artifacts can retrieve the fixed Sense
candidate instead of requiring a manually extracted package:

```bash
node scripts/configure-voice.mjs --model sensevoice-small-q8 --experimental-download
sudo bash scripts/deploy.sh --voice sensevoice-small-q8 --voice-experimental-download
# Later upgrades can opt in explicitly too:
sudo bash scripts/upgrade.sh --voice sensevoice-small-q8 --voice-experimental-download
```

The implemented Windows equivalents are `-VoiceModel sensevoice-small-q8
-VoiceExperimentalDownload` on `setup.ps1` / `deploy.ps1`; their existence does
not clear or authorize public distribution of the Windows candidate.
When deploying without Dev Tunnels, `deploy.ps1 -NoTunnel` uses the existing
loopback/own-HTTPS-proxy mode; `setup.ps1` still includes tunnel provisioning.

The catalog pins repository/run/artifact identities, archive and manifest hashes;
it does not select the latest build. **Current candidates expire on 2026-10-24.**
Expired, inaccessible or mismatched artifacts fail explicitly, without fallback
or changing the voice configuration. There is no permanent-download promise.
Do not combine experimental acquisition with local package arguments. Keep and
disable do not download or require GitHub authentication.

With `sudo`, the installing identity must have access to the GitHub credentials.
Do not put tokens in command arguments, `.env.local`, service units or issue
reports. The configurator imports ZIP files using bundled CLI dependencies; the
offline import path does not require `gh`. Standalone configuration does not
restart a service: restart the app and reload the page afterward.

Without `--experimental-download`, enabling requires the verified local package
arguments above and otherwise fails explicitly. Do not substitute a profiler's binary.
Sense defaults to two threads; `--threads 1|2|4` (deploy: `--voice-threads`) changes
the computation setting, not a hard CPU quota. Whisper defaults to one thread.

Setup checks platform, instruction set, Linux glibc or Windows OS compatibility,
staging disk space, the manifest and every declared file's SHA-256. Linux shows
available host memory, visible cgroup values and model measurements; Windows
reports physical memory, logical CPUs/current-group affinity and Job membership
with effective nested Job limits explicitly unknown. Neither invents a 4GiB
minimum. Installer resource
observations may differ from a separately configured service. Lower resources
can reduce performance or cause failure; no memory reservation is made.

Assets and license/provenance files are staged under `.data/voice`, then installed
by manifest hash. `.env.local` changes atomically after successful verification;
unrelated keys are retained, and old packages are not automatically deleted.
Conflicting inherited voice settings, `.env.production.local` or
`/etc/agents-chat.env` block changes with an explicit error instead of silently
overriding higher-priority configuration. Windows also checks the target
account's user/volatile and machine registry voice settings, case-insensitively.
Custom service-unit/task environment overrides or stale logon environments must
also be reviewed by the administrator. Keep never probes a different account.

Standalone configuration saves a private recovery receipt at
`.data/voice/last-setup.json`. It contains the prior environment file: **do not
publish it or attach it to issue reports**. To undo that change:

```bash
node scripts/configure-voice.mjs --rollback-receipt .data/voice/last-setup.json
```

Rollback refuses to overwrite configuration changed since setup. Restart the app
after standalone setup/rollback. `deploy.sh` uses a private temporary receipt and
restores voice configuration if activation/health checking fails; it does not
roll back application code or unrelated deployment changes. `--wait 0` skips the
health check and therefore cannot detect subsequent activation failure.
An interrupted installer can leave `.data/voice/setup.lock`; check that no setup
is running before removing that specific lock. Preserve `.env.local` and
`.data/voice` when replacing standalone release files.

### Chat persistence and proxy limits

The browser saves only new or changed messages. Small updates are batched below
512 KiB; individually larger messages, attachments, and ACP prompt/context
payloads use resumable 256 KiB binary chunks (about 350 KiB per JSON request).
The final save/send request contains a small upload reference. Nginx's default
1 MiB request limit therefore does not require increasing. ACP tool and thinking
parts remain server-owned and are not uploaded back by the browser.

Before clearing the composer, saves enter an IndexedDB outbox scoped to the
authenticated user and application chat ID, not the rotating ACP session ID.
User messages must also be confirmed by the server before agent dispatch.
Network requests time out after 30 seconds; retries reuse the same immutable
operation ID. Successful commits and their receipts are atomic, so a lost
acknowledgement does not duplicate messages. Refresh/online recovery retries
pending saves, **never agent execution**. Use the message's **Retry** action
explicitly when you want to send a recovered question to an agent.
Interrupted sends retain a pending-confirmation state even in chats with existing
agent sessions; recovery exposes Retry with a warning to check existing replies.
This includes replies sent from the workflow follow-up card.
Only the submitted composer revision and attachments are cleared after local
staging, so typing the next message while storage is busy does not erase it.
Navigation cancels active save requests without discarding unconfirmed drafts.
Recovery adopts newer server revisions and ignores stale reads that would move
the confirmed message version backwards.

The local drafts panel provides server/local comparison, JSON download (including
attachments), discard, and **Save as new message**.
Recovery copies reuse a durable operation associated with the source draft,
including when their acknowledgement is lost. Attachment-only copies retain
their retry prompt and original agent selection.
Switching accounts isolates both drafts and recovery error/busy state; delayed
callbacks from the previous account cannot consume drafts or replace the current
conversation with their response.
Different message IDs merge; conflicting edits to the same ID are retained locally rather than silently
overwriting another device. Deleted chats have persistent tombstones: delayed
saves cannot resurrect them, and recovered copies use a new chat ID. Same-browser
tabs coordinate uploads with renewable 60-second IndexedDB leases; server version
checks and idempotency remain authoritative across devices.

Each serialized upload is limited to 64 MiB; existing attachment limits still
apply (8 files, 10 MiB each, 25 MiB total before Base64 encoding). Incomplete
uploads expire after 24 hours, with at most 128 uploads / 256 MiB reserved per user.
Successful clients release uploads after acknowledgement. Browser storage
availability/quota failures are explicit: keep the tab open and copy/download
the message if local storage is unavailable. Clearing browser data also deletes
unsynced drafts. HTTPS or localhost is required for browser cryptographic upload
checksums. This change does not recover messages already missing from the database.

### Binary release bundles

GitHub Releases can also publish prebuilt runtime bundles for Windows and Linux. Each release asset contains the Next.js standalone server output, static assets, `public/`, `.env.example`, and startup scripts:

- Linux: `agents-chat-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- Windows: `agents-chat-windows-x64.zip`

Create a release by pushing a tag such as `v0.1.0`:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The release workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml` will build both bundles and upload them to the matching GitHub Release draft. After downloading a bundle:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
PORT=3010 ./scripts/start-release.sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-release.ps1
```

### Deployment (Windows Scheduled Task)

For persistent deployment on a Windows machine, use `scripts\deploy.ps1` which manages a Scheduled Task that auto-starts the app on login/boot.

```powershell
# Deploy (pulls latest code, restarts the service, waits for readiness)
.\scripts\deploy.ps1

# Deploy without git pull
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -SkipGitPull

# Deploy with AtStartup trigger (runs even without login)
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -TaskTriggerType AtStartup -TaskLogonType S4U

# Remove the scheduled task entirely
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -RemoveTask
```

The deploy script:
1. Pulls latest code from git (unless `-SkipGitPull`)
2. Stops the existing Scheduled Task and cleans up port 3000
3. Restarts the task so the app rebuilds and serves again
4. Waits up to 180s for `localhost:3000` to respond

Logs are written to `logs/service-watchdog.log` and `logs/start-service-child.log`.

### Deployment (Linux systemd)

For persistent deployment on Ubuntu/Debian, use `scripts/deploy.sh` — it installs the systemd unit on first run and updates the deployment on subsequent runs.

```bash
# First time on a machine (installs the unit, builds, enables auto-start, starts)
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh

# Subsequent updates: git pull + npm ci + build + restart + health check
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh --no-pull          # rebuild + restart without git pull
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh --no-install       # skip npm ci (no dep changes)
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh --wait 0           # don't wait for health check (default 120s)
```

The service runs as whoever invoked the script — `sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh` means everything (git, npm, the Node process) runs as `root`. If you want a different user, run the script directly as that user (you'll still need a separate path to grant systemctl access, e.g. polkit).

Manage the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status   agents-chat
sudo systemctl restart  agents-chat
sudo systemctl stop     agents-chat
sudo journalctl -u agents-chat -f          # live log stream
```

Environment variables are loaded from two files (later wins):

1. **`.env.local`** in the project root — the same file Next.js reads. systemd loads it into the unit's environment so `npm start` sees `PORT`, `LOG_*`, etc. before Node starts.
2. **`/etc/agents-chat.env`** (optional) — machine-level overrides that take precedence over `.env.local`.

> systemd's `EnvironmentFile` parser accepts `KEY=value` or `KEY="value"` per line. It does **not** support `export KEY=...`, single quotes, or `${VAR}` interpolation. Keep `.env.local` to plain `KEY=VALUE` lines if you want the unit to read them.

```bash
sudo tee /etc/agents-chat.env > /dev/null <<EOF
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=debug
LOG_DIR=/var/log/agents-chat
EOF
sudo systemctl restart agents-chat
```

### Logging

The server uses **pino + pino-roll** for structured logs. Defaults:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` (prod) / `debug` (dev) | `trace` / `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` / `fatal` |
| `LOG_DIR` | `<project>/logs` | Absolute or relative path |
| `LOG_FILE` | `app.log` | Base file name |
| `LOG_ROTATE_FREQUENCY` | `daily` | `daily` / `hourly` / milliseconds |
| `LOG_ROTATE_SIZE` | `10m` | Max size before mid-period rotation |
| `LOG_RETENTION` | `7` | Number of rotated files to keep |

Files written under `$LOG_DIR`:

- `app.<date>.<n>.log` — pino structured JSON (rotated)

On Linux, stdout/stderr are also captured by journald (`journalctl -u agents-chat`).

## Features

- **Multi-agent chat** — Talk to one ACP agent or mention multiple agents in one message.
- **@mention routing** — Type `@agent-id` to target specific agents; messages without mentions go to the currently selected/default agent.
- **Auto agent orchestration** — A scheduler agent decides which agent should act next, evaluates results, and produces a final summary.
- **Discussion orchestration** — Run multiple agents in parallel for configurable rounds, then summarize.
- **Pipeline orchestration** — Run agents sequentially, passing each output to the next.
- **File attachments** — Drag-and-drop or click to attach images and files to messages (up to 8 files, 10 MB each).
- **Files tab** — Browse an agent's working directory (local _or_ remote/relay agents), filter to changed files, open files inline, edit Markdown with split preview or live editing, and save changes back to disk. For relay agents the backend auto-connects the node and resolves `cwd` from the remote machine.
- **Model selection** — Per-agent model picker synced from the agent's available models.
- **Slash commands** — Type `/` in a single-agent chat to pick from the agent's ACP-advertised slash commands (autocomplete dropdown).
- **In-app ACP sign-in** — Agents that require authentication (e.g., Copilot CLI) expose a sign-in flow directly in the UI; the composer surfaces a `needs auth` pill when a turn fails because of missing auth and verifies sign-in actually succeeded.
- **Scheduler / cron jobs** — Schedule any agent to run on a cron expression with per-job run timeout, a themed time picker, and schedule times rendered in the user's local timezone.
- **Environment variables** — Per-agent KEY=VALUE configuration for API keys and agent settings.
- **Themes** — 5 built-in themes (Aurora, Sunset, VS Code Dark, Claude, ChatGPT).
- **Message actions** — Copy (plain), **Copy with format** (rich Markdown→HTML/Markdown, excluding thinking and tool-call DOM), retry, or branch from any message.
- **Mention autocomplete** — Typing `@` filters the agent dropdown as you type.
- **Full screen toggle** — Header button (desktop + mobile) to expand the chat into full screen.
- **Multi-turn queue** — Send follow-up messages while an agent is processing; turns are queued and executed in order.
- **Streaming responses** — Real-time streaming with phase indicators for thinking, tool execution, and replying.
- **Agent management** — Add, configure, remove, and permission agents from the UI. The "last used agent" is persisted per-user on the server.
- **Relay agents** — Connect to remote agents on other machines via Azure Relay.
- **Node registry** — Register and discover remote agent nodes; auto-discovers Azure Relay hybrid connections. The Node Setup Kit lets you choose the launcher (Copilot CLI or Agency).
- **Chat history** — Persistent message history in SQLite (`.data/chats.db`) with sidebar run status, sorted newest-first and filtered to the signed-in user.
- **Session resume** — Reloading a chat restores agent session context via `session/load`.
- **Shared chats** — Generate a read-only share link for any conversation, with Open Graph image optimized for Teams previews.
- **Mobile responsive** — Full-featured UI on phones and tablets with swipeable panels and touch-friendly controls. On mobile, the sidebar collapse button closes the navigation drawer; the header navigation button reopens the full Chats/Files tabs without changing the saved desktop collapse preference.
- **Authentication** — Azure AD SSO, **GitHub OAuth**, or local credentials login; admin/user roles.

## Using the app

### Chat and message routing

1. Select or create a chat from the left **Chats** sidebar.
2. Type a normal message to send it to the default selected agent.
3. Type `@agent-id` to route the message to a specific agent.
4. Mention multiple agents, for example `@frontend @reviewer implement and review this change`, to enable orchestration controls in the composer.

The chat sidebar shows each chat's recent status so you can switch away while a turn is running and still see whether it is `Running`, `Done`, or `Error`.

### Auto agent orchestration

When a message mentions more than one agent, the composer exposes orchestration modes:

- **Auto** — A scheduler agent plans the next step, chooses one of the mentioned agents, waits for its result, then decides whether another agent should run or whether to produce a final summary.
- **Discussion** — All mentioned agents respond in parallel. You can choose the number of discussion rounds. A summary is generated after the final round.
- **Pipeline** — Agents run in the order they were mentioned. Each agent receives the previous agent's output.

Auto mode is useful when the task has conditional flow, such as "ask one agent to implement, then have another test/review depending on the result." The scheduler is routing-only: it should pick agents and write instructions rather than doing project work itself.

### Slash commands

In a chat targeting a single agent, type `/` in the composer to open a dropdown of the agent's ACP-advertised slash commands. Selecting one inserts the command; arguments (if any) can be typed after it. Slash commands are only shown when the chat targets exactly one agent.

### Scheduler (cron jobs)

Any agent can be scheduled to run on a cron expression:

1. Open the agent's settings or the **Scheduler** UI.
2. Pick a cron schedule using the themed picker (times are displayed in your local timezone).
3. Set an optional **per-job run timeout** so a stuck job is cancelled automatically.
4. Save. The job will fire on schedule, run a turn against the agent, and record the result.

### In-app ACP sign-in

Some ACP agents (for example GitHub Copilot CLI) require authentication before they can answer prompts. When an agent reports it needs auth:

- The composer surfaces a **needs auth** pill.
- Open the agent's panel and click **Sign in**. The UI runs the agent's `authenticate` ACP flow and verifies the sign-in actually completed before clearing the pill.

### Files tab

The left sidebar has two tabs: **Chats** and **Files**.

Use **Files** to inspect and edit files from any agent's working directory (local _or_ relay):

1. Open the **Files** tab.
2. Choose an agent from the dropdown. Relay agents are supported — the backend auto-connects the node and resolves the working directory from the remote machine.
3. Browse the file tree. The backend skips heavy/generated folders such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `.next`, `dist`, `build`, and binary/media file extensions.
4. Click a file to open it inline.
5. For Markdown files, choose:
   - **Split** — text editor plus rendered preview.
   - **Live Edit** — editable rendered Markdown.
6. Click **Save** to write changes back to the agent's working directory.

The **Diff / Changed** toggle lists only files changed according to git (`git diff --name-only HEAD` plus untracked files). Files listing no longer has an artificial file-count cap, but it still keeps traversal safety guards such as maximum depth and skipped directories/extensions.

### Agents

Agents are stored in SQLite (`.data/config.db`) and managed through the UI. On first boot the app auto-migrates any existing `agents.json` file.

#### Add a local/server agent from the UI

1. Open the right **Agents** panel.
2. Click **+**.
3. Choose **Add Agent in Server**. This option is admin-only because it starts a process on the app server.
4. Fill in:
   - **Agent ID** — unique lowercase identifier, used for `@mentions`.
   - **Display Name** — human-friendly name in the UI.
   - **Command** — ACP-compatible executable, for example `copilot.exe`, or an absolute path.
   - **Arguments** — space-separated arguments, commonly `--acp`.
   - **Working Directory** — project folder where the agent should run.
   - **YOLO mode** — auto-approve mode; the backend appends the relevant yolo flag where supported.
5. Click **Create Agent**.

#### Add a GitHub Copilot CLI agent

1. Open the right **Agents** panel → **+** → **Add Agent in Server**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Agent ID** — e.g. `copilot`
   - **Display Name** — e.g. `GitHub Copilot`
   - **Command** — `copilot.exe` (or full path to the Copilot CLI binary)
   - **Arguments** — `--acp`
   - **Working Directory** — project folder
   - **YOLO mode** — check to auto-approve tool calls
3. Click **Create Agent**.

#### Add a Claude Code agent

Claude Code can be added as an ACP agent using the `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` package:

1. Open the right **Agents** panel → **+** → **Add Agent in Server**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Agent ID** — e.g. `claude-code`
   - **Display Name** — e.g. `claude-code`
   - **Command** — `npx`
   - **Arguments** — `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest`
   - **Working Directory** — project folder where Claude should operate
   - **YOLO mode** — check to auto-approve tool calls
3. Click **Create Agent**.

##### Using with an Anthropic API key

Set the following in the agent's **Environment Variables** textarea (in Settings):

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

> **Important:** Leave the model picker on the model you set in env after starting the agent. The `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var controls which model is used. Selecting a model from the picker will override the env var with an incompatible internal name, causing "model not supported" errors.

#### Other supported ACP agents

Any ACP-compatible tool can be added. Here are common examples:

**Gemini CLI**
```json
{
  "id": "gemini",
  "name": "Gemini CLI",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@google/gemini-cli@latest", "--experimental-acp"],
  "cwd": ""
}
```

**Codex CLI**
```json
{
  "id": "codex",
  "name": "Codex CLI",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@zed-industries/codex-acp@latest"],
  "cwd": ""
}
```

**OpenClaw**
```json
{
  "id": "openclaw",
  "name": "OpenClaw",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["openclaw", "acp"],
  "cwd": ""
}
```

**Hermes Agent**
```json
{
  "id": "hermes",
  "name": "Hermes Agent",
  "command": "hermes",
  "args": ["acp"],
  "cwd": ""
}
```

For any `npx`-based agent, set **Command** to `npx` and **Arguments** to the package name + flags.

#### Add a remote/relay agent from the UI

Remote agents run on a registered node and connect through Azure Relay.

Option A — from the **Agents** panel:

1. Open **Agents** → **+** → **Add Agent from Remote Node**.
2. Choose a node.
3. Enter an agent ID, display name, and working directory on that remote machine.
4. Click **Create Remote Agent**.

Option B — from the **Nodes** panel:

1. Open **Nodes**.
2. Click the `＋` action on a node row.
3. Enter an agent ID, display name, and working directory.
4. Click **Create Relay Agent**.

Relay agents are stored with `relay: true` and `relayConnectionName` pointing at the node/hybrid connection.

#### Seed agents with `agents.json`

To seed agents without the UI, create `agents.json` at the project root before first boot:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "copilot",
      "name": "GitHub Copilot CLI",
      "command": "copilot.exe",
      "args": ["--acp"],
      "cwd": "C:\\work",
      "yolo": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Agent fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique agent identifier used for `@mentions` |
| `name` | Display name |
| `command` | Path to the ACP executable for local/server agents |
| `args` | Command line arguments, default commonly `["--acp"]` |
| `cwd` | Working directory for the agent process |
| `yolo` | Auto-approve mode |
| `noTools` | Disable tool calls; agent responds as chat-only, usually faster |
| `relay` | Connect via Azure Relay WebSocket instead of local process |
| `relayConnectionName` | Azure Relay hybrid connection/node name, required when `relay: true` |
| `env` | Environment variables passed to the agent process (KEY=VALUE per line in UI, JSON object in `agents.json`) |
| `public` | Allow all authenticated users to talk to this agent; default is owner-only |

### Nodes

Nodes represent remote machines that can host relay agents. A node is backed by an Azure Relay hybrid connection.

#### Add a node with the setup kit

1. Configure Azure Relay variables in `.env.local` or deployment app settings:
   - `RELAY_SEND_CONNECTION_STRING` for server-side relay connections and node probing.
   - optionally `RELAY_KEY_VAULT_NAME` and `RELAY_KEY_VAULT_SECRET_NAME`; these values are embedded into newly downloaded setup ZIPs so the remote node can fetch `RELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` from Key Vault.
   - optionally `RELAY_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `RELAY_RESOURCE_GROUP`; these values are embedded into newly downloaded setup ZIPs so the remote node can create/update/delete its Hybrid Connection.
   - optionally `RELAY_NAMESPACE` for auto-discovery.
   Restart or redeploy the app and download a new `copilot-node-setup.zip` after changing these environment variables.
2. Open the **Nodes** panel.
3. Click **+** to open **Node Setup Kit**.
4. Choose the launcher you want the node to run (**Copilot CLI** or **Agency**) and download `copilot-node-setup.zip`.
5. Copy/extract it on the remote devbox.
6. Open PowerShell in the extracted folder.
7. Run:

```powershell
.\setup-node.ps1
```

The kit includes `setup-node.ps1` and `relay-listener.js`. Prerequisites shown in the UI are Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Azure CLI logged in. After setup, the node appears in the **Nodes** panel automatically when discovery is configured.

#### Manage nodes

- Click **↻** in the Nodes panel to refresh node status.
- Click a node row to probe/refresh that node.
- Online nodes show a filled status dot.
- Double-click a node name to rename it when you have permission.
- Click `＋` on a node row to create a relay agent on that node.
- Click `✕` on a node row to remove a node you can modify.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, CSS modules + styled-jsx, react-markdown.
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes managing ACP agent processes, relay WebSockets, chat persistence, file browsing, config, and auth.
- **Protocol**: NDJSON-RPC over stdio for local agents; WebSocket for relay agents.
- **Storage**: SQLite via better-sqlite3 — `.data/chats.db` for chat history and shared chats, `.data/config.db` for agent/node config.
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with Azure AD SSO or local credentials providers.

## ACP Protocol Flow

1. **Spawn/connect** — Start a local agent process with configured command + args, or connect to a relay node via Azure Relay.
2. **Initialize** — Send `initialize` with `protocolVersion: 1`.
3. **New Session** — Send `session/new` with working directory and MCP server list.
4. **Prompt** — Send `session/prompt` with the user message.
5. **Stream** — Receive `session/update` notifications for thinking, tool execution, and response chunks.
6. **Complete** — Prompt resolves when the agent finishes; the next queued turn starts automatically.
7. **Resume** — On reconnect, send `session/load` to restore prior session context.

The backend handles server-side requests from agents, including terminal management (`terminal/create`, `terminal/output`, `terminal/wait_for_exit`, etc.) and file system access (`fs/read_text_file`, `fs/write_text_file`).

## Data Migration

If migrating from a legacy JSON-file setup:

```bash
npx tsx lib/migrate.ts
```

## Tests

Tests are Playwright E2E plus lightweight Node regression checks. Playwright expects the app running on `localhost:3010`.

The **Playwright E2E** workflow runs on every PR targeting `main` and every push to `main`.
It builds and serves the production app with isolated CI credentials, runs desktop Chromium
in four shards, and runs Android Chromium and iPhone WebKit as independent jobs. Desktop
failures do not prevent mobile coverage from running. Mobile checks cover navigation and
overlay state, sidebar collapse/reopen and desktop preference preservation across breakpoints,
narrow screens and landscape, keyboard/composer geometry, file previews,
and management panels. Failed jobs upload HTML reports, traces, screenshots, and server logs.
Do not run stateful E2E tests against a production instance or its database.

```bash
